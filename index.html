    <h2>Work Experience</h2>
    <p>
      2018-2019 - Substitute clown for the Anytown Circus. Here I made funny
      faces, twirled a baton, and farted in my clown suit.
    </p>
    <p>
      2019-2021 - Primary clown for Yourtown Circus. In addition to farting in
      my clown suit, I made faces at small children and bid them to go away. I
      chewed gum and put it in the bad ones hair when they were not paying
      attention. I dressed bystanders in my clown suit so I could take naps in
      the afternoon. When I had an especially bad day, I retreated to my parents
      attic where I curled up in a fetal position and cried for an hour or two.

    <p>
      2021-present - I mix up lye solutions for cold process soap making. I mix
      up the oils and lye, then split into smaller portions and add various
      dyes. Then I pour the soap into molds. After that, I unmold the soap, cut
      it, and allow to cure. Once cured, I sell it for 3 times as much as it
      cost me to make it.
